========================

Attys is a lightweight bluetooth DAQ box which can measure anything from temperature to ECG.

Required packages under Linux
=============================

For Ubuntu Linux install libbluetooth-dev::

      sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev

For other Linux flavours install them from souce:

Quick start guide
=================

Here are the basic steps how to use the API::

      # load the module
      import pyattyscomm

      # Gets the AttysScan class which scans for Attys via bluetooth
      s = pyattyscomm.AttysScan()

      # Scan for Attys
      s.scan()

      # get the 1st Attys
      c = s.getAttysComm(0)

      # if an attys has been found c points to it. Otherwise it's None.

      # Start data acquisition in the background
      c.start()

      # Now we just read data at our convenience in a loop or timer or thread
      # if data is available you can read it from the ringBuffer

      while (not c.hasSampleAvilabale()):
      	    # do something else or nothing

      # getting a sample (array of all Attys channels)
      sample = c.getSampleFromBuffer()

      # do something with the sample
      print(sample)

      # rinse and repeat!


API documentation
==================

Query it via the python help system::

    import pyattyscomm
    help(pyattyscomm.AttysScan)
    help(pyattyscomm.AttysComm)


The Python classes have been generated with SWIG. The header files AttysComm.h and AttysScan.h provide detailed info about the classes:

Demos
=====

On github are two python examples which print the
ADC data to the screen and plots it.
